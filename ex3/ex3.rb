#My grandmother doesn't have a really good memory, so always that she asks us if she is called some way, we have to reply her
#real name. For example:
#Kate?
#Mary
#Martha?
#Mary
#Karen?
#Mary
#Define a class that replies 'Mary' to any question. Only if it's a question and if it's not already defined, for sure.
